Procedure:

1. Put all the poppy seeds in a masala grinder, and grind till you get a fine powder. Mix with a little water to make a thick paste.

2. Peel and cut the potatoes into cubes.

3. In a wok, add mustard oil, cumin, and red chillies. Once it starts to splutter, add the potato cubes, with the turmeric powder. Saute the potatoes till they turn slightly golden. Add the poppy seed paste. Make sure the potatoes are completely coated in the poppy seed paste, and cook on medium heat for 3-4 minutes.

4. Add 3/4 cup water, salt, sugar, and green chillies. Cook covered, stirring at intervals, till the potatoes are done. Traditionally, this is a dry sabzi , so you can wait for the gravy to dry up, or you can add a little more water, and stop cooking till your gravy reaches the consistency you want.

5. Once done, you can add 1 teaspoon of mustard oil, and stir it through.

6. Serve hot with steamed rice.
